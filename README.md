## Buy me a Coffee
Numerous remarkable efforts are underway, yielding astonishing results. Researchers and individuals globally are tirelessly contemplating and exploring the wonders of this incredible universe. I am not assessing anyone's research at this work, nor do I possess a particular criterion for listing the papers. I regularly update these, but I have no intention of accumulating thousands of papers. It's all about the select few that truly engage my thoughts for an entire day!
